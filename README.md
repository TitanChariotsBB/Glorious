# Glorious

A stereo chorus plugin made with JUCE

### What is this?

Glorious is a [chorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorus_(audio_effect)#Electronic_effect) effect plugin. It takes in an audio signal, duplicates it, slightly changing the pitch of the duplicates, and outputs the signal and duplicates. The result is the impression multiple "voices" instead of one, like a group of violinists playing the same melody.

### Background

I originally created the algorithm for this chorus in high school in the (Audulus)[https://audulus.com/] modular synthesis/visual programming environment. Later I implemented it in (csound)[https://csound.com/]. I decided implementing the algorithm "for real" in JUCE would be a great way learn C++ and the JUCE framework.
