### What is this?

Glorious is a [chorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorus_(audio_effect)#Electronic_effect) effect plugin. It takes in an audio signal, duplicates it, slightly changing the pitch of the duplicates, and outputs the signal and duplicates. The result is the impression multiple "voices" instead of one, like a group of violinists playing the same melody.
